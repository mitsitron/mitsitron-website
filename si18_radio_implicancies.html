            The Special Issue #18, “Radio Implicancies”, is a series of eight weekly released sound     publications created by the XPUB master´s
            students. We have been shapeshifting each Tuesday of the week into our own audience and constantly shuffled positions
            in the overall work infrastructure.
            <br><br>
            This modular approach enabled an interdependent publishing structure in which we all took turn in order to share
            responsibilities in a sustainable manner.
            <br><br>
            Every other Tuesday of each week, somehow estranged from everyone’s work progress, all the members, except the
            care-takers (those responsible of the outcome of that week’s publication), would walk into a dedicated room
            unaware of the experience they would step into.
            <br><br>
            The publications shifted from edited projects to live performances, presenting tools, interface or instruments for the
            public to thread all the pieces together themselves.
            <br><br>
