            Gender is usually perceived through a visual lens: through a body’s anatomy and surface; through how someone looks or
            moves inside a space. As it is an underresearched area, I would like to locate gender inscriptions through sound: 
            I wonder in which ways we can hear and deconstruct gender essentialism, if we approach it through a voice produced by somebody’s 
            phonatory system, or through a system of sounds emerging from a body’s relation to a technological artefact - like a guitar -.
            <br><br>
            Alongside this, I wonder in which ways a guitar located inside a patriarchal, anthropocentric and ableist culture 
            orients a body into cis-heteronormativity and in which ways can a guitar support a fluid gender expression? 
            What are the consequences of technically classifying one’s voice to a gender binary depending on their vocal pitch?
            In which ways can a voice deconstruct these technical classifications, while connecting to the here and now of its
            embodied situation? What can be the processes that help to caress and amplify queer voices?
