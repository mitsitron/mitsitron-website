        <it>...and I wish that your question has been answered</it> is a User Interface for replacing words with words. 
        It is an open process for remaking the speeches of Mark Rutte and Kyriakos Mitsotakis (November 2021) on the refugees' pushbacks taking place at the european borders. 
        We wonder how the use of language can justify state violence, naturalise anti-refugee policies, plant and grow nationalism and necropolitics.
        <br><br>
        The interface includes three functions. 
        The function “respell” receives text and substitutes all the occurrences of a target-word with a replacement chosen by the user. 
        The function “stitch” replaces all the occurrences of a target-word with a single character that is repeated as many times as the length of the target. 
        The third function “reveal” deletes all the words of Mark Rutte and Kyriakos Mitsotakis except the target-word(s) given by the user.
        Every new answer, every new iteration, can be submitted to our Archive of Repetitive Answers.
        By targeting specific words and replacing them for other words, characters or blank spaces the user can keep changing the text.
