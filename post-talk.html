            Post Talk is the project of Al Nik, Francessco Luzzana, Supisara Burapaishri, Mitsitron and other friends who jump in.
            We have been questioning performance as a concept, oftentimes associated with perfection, pressure and preparedness.
            <br><br>
            What if we focus on the process instead? Is there a way to embrace amateurism, slowness, latency and even failure?
            <br><br>
            To put our attention on the small scale instruments and sounds, to play with the basics?
            <br><br>
            To try to create space for us and others instead of competing for claiming one? 
            To create embodied knowledges, where by re-learning collectively the ways of creating sound 
            we can reposition ourselves inside a system of dynamics? Our sound jams explore these questions.
