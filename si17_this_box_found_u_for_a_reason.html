        This publication explores how (video) games features are making us more, not less, productive.
        Life and work are ‘gamified’ through social media, dating apps, and fitness apps designed to increase motivation and productivity.
        Gamification blurs the lines between play, leisure and labour, to release our collective dopamine for profit.
        Games in themselves often perform a reproductive role, presenting capitalism as a system of natural laws, exemplified by in-game predatory monetisation schemes.
        On the other hand, games provide necessary down time and relaxation, helping people function in a largely dysfunctional economy and society.
        Yet leisure remains a contested space which is still unequally distributed, between genders, ethnicities and abilities. The form of the publication reworks the figure of the loot box, a typically virtual and predatory monetization scheme.
        <i>This box found you for a reason</i> was made by the master students of XPUB in collaboration with
