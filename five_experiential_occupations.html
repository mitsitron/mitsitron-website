            This publication is dedicated to the occupation of Peiraiki-Patraiki´s factory in 1990 at Patras, Greece.
            <br><br>
            The occupation opposed the dismissals of nine hundred workers and the upcoming factory’s closing. 
            The factory closed on 1992 as part of a general de-industrialization that took place in Greece between the late 80’s and the early 90’s.
            <br><br>           
            For this publication we created an archive of oral narrations. We interviewed five employees that actively participated in the factory’s occupation.
            <br><br>
            We cared to understand how five different people reconstructed the moments of the collective occupation 28 years after. How their commemoration was influenced by their current feelings, but also the different roles that they embodied during the occupation.
            For this, we created five empirical maps distributing oral narrations to factory spaces.
