     <p>
        The Platform for Extratonality focuses on sonic (and neighboring) activities that reject distinctions between high and low, exceptional and
        boring, serious and pop. It streches the classical paradigms of music (balance, contrast, focus,movement, pattern,proportion, rhythm
        and unity) and expand them with conceptual, technical and performative principles from other disciplines.
     <br><br>
        Our program manifests itself in the form of conferences, performance evenings, radio shows and workshops. For each,
        we invite artists, musicians, poets and technicians from in and outside of Rotterdam to demonstrate various
        phenomenons and engage with our space and facilities. Our workshops and performance evenings have been hosted at
        Varia and our radio shows at Radio Worm, both in Rotterdam.
